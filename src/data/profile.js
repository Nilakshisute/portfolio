  bio: "Passionate frontend developer with expertise in creating responsive, user-friendly web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.",
  longBio: `I'm a frontend developer with over 5 years of experience building modern web applications. I specialize in React and have extensive experience with state management, responsive design, and performance optimization.

My journey in web development began when I built my first website for a local business while still in college. Since then, I've worked with startups and established companies to create engaging user experiences that drive business results.

I'm passionate about clean code, accessibility, and staying up-to-date with the latest frontend technologies. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, reading tech blogs, or contributing to open-source projects.`,
